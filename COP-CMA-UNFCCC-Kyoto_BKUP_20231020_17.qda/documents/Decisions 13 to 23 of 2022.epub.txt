 Welcomes the work under the structured expert dialogue on the second periodic review of the long-term global goal under the Convention and of overall progress towards achieving it (hereinafter referred to as the structured expert dialogue), which contributed to completing the phases of the second periodic review reflected in decision 2/CP.17, paragraph 164, and takes note of the synthesis report thereon,1 including the 10 key messages highlighted therein, and the summary reports on the meetings of the dialogue;2 
 
2. 
 
 Expresses its appreciation and gratitude to those involved in the structured expert dialogue, in particular its co-facilitators; 
 
3. 
 
 Also expresses its appreciation and gratitude for all the inputs provided to the second periodic review, including those made to the structured expert dialogue by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the secretariat, UNFCCC constituted bodies, and other United Nations bodies and organizations and the report of the 2020 round table on pre-2020 implementation and ambition; 
 
4. 
 
 Notes that work under the structured expert dialogue has been completed, as described in decision 1/CP.18, paragraphs 86–89, and that the dialogue covered the two themes of the second periodic review, as set out in decision 5/CP.25, paragraph 4(a–b); 5. 
 
 Reaffirms the long-term global goal of holding the increase in global average temperature to well below 2 °C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 °C above pre-industrial levels (hereinafter referred to as the long-term global goal), recognizing that this would significantly reduce the risks and impacts of climate change, as referred to in decision 10/CP.21, paragraph 4, and notes that it is assessed over a period of decades; 
 
6. 
 
 Expresses alarm and utmost concern that human activities have caused a global average temperature increase of around 1.1 °C above pre-industrial levels to date and that impacts are already being felt in every region and will escalate with every increment of global warming; 
 
7. 
 
 Recalls that the impacts of climate change will be much lower at the temperature increase of 1.5 °C compared with 2 °C3 and acknowledges that limiting the global average temperature increase to 1.5 °C above pre-industrial levels with no or limited overshoot would avoid increasingly severe climate change impacts, stressing that the severity of impacts will be reduced with every increment of global warming avoided; 
 
8. 
 
 Reaffirms that limiting global warming to 1.5 °C requires rapid, deep and sustained reductions in global greenhouse gas emissions, including reducing global carbon dioxide 1 FCCC/SB/2022/3.

emissions by 45 per cent by 2030 relative to the 2010 level and to net zero around mid-century as well as deep reductions in other greenhouse gas emissions;4 
 
9. 
 
 Notes that information and knowledge have improved significantly since the first periodic review (2013–2015), while there continue to be important information and knowledge gaps in relation to the areas covered within the scope of the second periodic review set out in decision 5/CP.25, paragraph 4, and encourages the scientific community to address these gaps; 
 
10. 
 
 Notes that the Synthesis Report of the Sixth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is expected to be completed by March 2023 and invites the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change to present the findings therein at the fifty-eighth session of the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice (June 2023); 
 
11. 
 
 Notes that it is still possible to achieve the long-term global goal with immediate, rapid, deep and sustained reductions in overall aggregated global greenhouse gas emissions, while recognizing that there are challenges relating to mitigation, adaptation, and means of implementation and support; 
 
12. 
 
 Also notes that current policies and measures are insufficient for achieving the long-term global goal and the window of opportunity for achieving the goal is closing; 13. 
 
 Further notes that valuable information was provided during the structured expert dialogue on how Parties can effect transformational change across key systems and sectors; 
 
14. 
 
 Underscores the need to pursue anticipatory, incremental and transformative adaptation and address the factors underlying increasing vulnerability and risks, including lack of capacity to respond to climate change, and that most adaptation to date has been incremental, with little evidence of transformative adaptation, and tracking progress of adaptation planning remains difficult; 
 
15. 
 
 Notes that, despite overall progress on mitigation, adaptation and means of implementation and support, Parties are not collectively on track to achieve the long-term global goal and that the pre-2020 pledges of some Parties and their subsequent implementation have been insufficient; 
 
16. 
 
 Also notes that there are still significant gaps between collectively pledged emission reductions and the reductions required to achieve the long-term global goal, as well as gaps in support for adaptation and means of implementation for developing country Parties, especially those that are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change, as provided for in the Convention; 
 
17. 
 
 Acknowledges that, in order to shift to and remain on a pathway to achieving the long-term global goal, Parties must enhance their efforts under the Convention and the Paris Agreement to significantly reduce their aggregated emissions prior to 2030, while recognizing the financial, technological, economic, capacity-building and institutional challenges and needs and special circumstances of developing country Parties, especially those that are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change, as provided for in the Convention; 18. 
 
 Notes that, although some progress has already been made by the UNFCCC, its constituted bodies and other entities in scaling up financial, technological and capacity-building support, these enablers for climate action are not yet aligned with the urgency of a rapid, just and equitable low-emission and climate-resilient transition and significant gaps still exist in terms of both the scale and the speed of such progress; 
 
19. 
 
 Recognizes that climate finance has increased since the first periodic review but is still inadequate to address the needs and priorities, reiterates that developed country Parties provide enhanced support, including through financial resources, technology transfer and capacity-building, to assist developing country Parties with respect to both mitigation and adaptation, in continuation of their existing obligations under the Convention, and encourages other Parties to provide or continue to provide such support voluntarily; 4 Decision 1/CP.26, para. 17. 
 

 
41 
FCCC/CP/2022/10/Add.2 
 
20. 
 
 Notes that Parties have different responsibilities, national circumstances and capabilities to contribute to achieving the long-term global goal, while the impacts and risks associated with warming are unevenly distributed, and in this regard also notes the need for enhanced efforts towards achieving the long-term global goal, taking into account ambition, equity, just transition and the best available science; 
 
21. 
 
 Further notes that the outputs of the structured expert dialogue could serve as input to the first global stocktake, pursuant to decision 19/CMA.1, paragraph 37(c), as well as other relevant processes under the Convention and the Paris Agreement; 22. 
 
 Decides to consider the continuation of periodic reviews at its twenty-ninth session (November 2024) pursuant to decision 5/CP.25, paragraph 8; 23. 
 
 Notes that the second periodic review fulfilled its mandate as contained in decisions 1/CP.16, 1/CP.17, 2/CP.17, 1/CP.18 and 5/CP.25.

 Emphasizes the need to address systematic observation gaps, particularly in developing countries and for ocean, mountain, desert and polar regions and the cryosphere in order to improve understanding of climate change, climate-related risks and tipping points, and adaptation limits and to ensure enhanced delivery of climate services and early warning systems; 
 
4. 
 
 Notes with concern the existing gaps in the global climate observing system and recognizes the need to enhance the coordination of activities by the systematic observation community and improve its ability to provide useful and actionable climate information for mitigation, adaptation and early warning systems, as well as information to enable understanding of adaptation limits and of attribution of extreme events.
