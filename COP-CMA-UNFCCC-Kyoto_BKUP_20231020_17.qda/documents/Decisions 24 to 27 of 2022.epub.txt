 2. 
 
 Recognizes with concern the unprecedented crisis caused by the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, the uneven nature of the global response to the pandemic and the pandemic’s multifaceted effects on all spheres of society, including the deepening of pre-existing inequalities, including gender inequality, and resulting vulnerabilities, which negatively impacted the implementation of the gender action plan, which has negatively impacted the implementation of effective gender-responsive climate action, and urges Parties to accelerate their efforts to advance implementation of the enhanced Lima work programme on gender and its gender action plan; 
 
3.

 5. 
 
 Notes with appreciation the informal report by the secretariat on the in-session workshop on the role of national gender and climate change focal points4 and, taking into account the evolving and Party-driven nature of the work and role of such focal points, also notes with appreciation the identification of enablers to facilitate the national gender and climate change focal points in carrying out their role, according to national circumstances;
